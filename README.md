# Event-Driven-Programming
Create a Java GUI app simulating an e-store called Nile Dot Com. Users can add in-stock items to a cart, total costs (including tax), generate an invoice, and log transactions. The app will allow users to manage their cart, review costs, and complete purchases efficiently while maintaining a transaction history for future reference.
